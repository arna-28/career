          <p>Criminology is the study of crime, its causes, effects, and prevention, as well as the behavior of criminals and the functioning of the criminal justice system. It explores the social, psychological, and economic factors that contribute to criminal behavior, aiming to understand why crimes occur and how they can be controlled or prevented. Criminologists analyze crime patterns, the effectiveness of laws, and rehabilitation methods to improve public safety and justice. The field intersects with sociology, psychology, law, and forensics, and plays a critical role in shaping policies related to crime prevention and criminal justice reform.</p>
